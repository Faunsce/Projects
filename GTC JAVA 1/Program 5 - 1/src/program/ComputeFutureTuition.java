/* 5.7 (Financial application: compute future tuition) Suppose the tuition
        for a university is $10,000 this year and increases 5% every year. In one
        year, the tuition will be $10,500. Write a program that displays the tuition in
        10 years, and the total cost of four yearsâ€™ worth of tuition after the tenth
        year.
